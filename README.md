# CMPINF0010 Skills Lab 7: The Age Group Sorter
   
### Description of Program
    
The program prompts users to input a series of name-age pairs that are sorted and printed according to their age group, combining names with ages 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, and 30+. Within each age group, the printed names will be in the order of their age.

### Usage

To use, first download the file cmpinf0010_skills_lab_6.ipynb. As a Jupyter Notebook file, a simple way to execute it is to upload it to Jupyter Notebook and Run the sole code block contained in the file. While it hasn't yet been tested, you may also be able to utilize nbconvert as described [here](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) if you have Jupyter installed locally.

Enter names and ages as prompted by the program, and enter "Exit" (without quotes) instead of a name to complete data entry.

As part of this assignment, we chose the preexisting license The Unlicense to make the project as widely useful as possible while keeping it firmly open-source. We also chose The Contributor Covenant as a code of conduct because of its widespread use and thus likely familiarity with many possible contributors.
